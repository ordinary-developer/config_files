# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.

<VirtualHost host1:80>
    ServerName host1
    DocumentRoot "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/host1"
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost host2:80>
    ServerName host2
    DocumentRoot "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/host2"
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost host3:80>
    ServerName host3
    DocumentRoot "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/host3"
</VirtualHost>
