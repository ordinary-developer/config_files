CONFIG_FILES
============
[project information]
------------
This project is simply all (or pratically all) my configuration files (in Linux, of course).

It contains
- **apache2** configuration files (very simple configuration);
- **sudoers** and **fstab** files from /etc directory;
- **vim** configuration files;
- **vifm** configuration files (a vim-like filemanager);
- **xorg** file for my notebook;
- **xorg** file for a virtual machine;
- **xterm** configuration files.


[installation]
------------
It is necessary to only copy this files to your configuration directories.

[basic usage]
------------
Nothing to say yet.

The project is licensed under the MIT license.

[contributing]

I think this project doesn't need any help, because it simply contains my configuration files.
